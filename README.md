<h1 align='center'>⬇️ Tokmate - Telegram Bot to download TikTok videos</h1>


# ⛲ Features

- Superfast and supports all type of TikTok links
- Download any TikTok videos without matermark
- Cache the videos so that future requests for that video can be served faster
- Inline support

---

## 🔒 Privacy

For any TikTok videos the bot uploads, the `TikTok URL` of that video and the `video_file_id` **(File Id of the video in the Telegram server)**  are stored in the database so that any future requests for that video can be served faster. 

**These data will not be associated with any users and the video is already public in the TikTok. So, the bot does not affect your privacy.**

*The `TikTok Url` and the `video_file_id` of the video requested from the inline query is not stored in the database.*

---

## ⚒️ Deployment

The bot relies on a third part website to get the video links which is not opensourced. So, you cannot deploy the bot on your own.
